Tic Tac Toe is as simple as it gets as a game played by kids. Yet I have learnt a lot of my shortcomings while writing the javascript logic and implementations.

It serves as a good reminder of how I should plan the skeletal structure of the whole application, as elaborated in this write-up: https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out

For example, it is necessary to have functions/DOM to check for win conditions, switching of players after move is made, updating/rendering of the html/UI each time a player makes a move, etc etc

It is good to think about what the core of my application needs before jumping straight into code mess.
